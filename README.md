In this project, a client-server application using TCP sockets is implemented. This 
application will operate as a cloud file storage and publishing system. In the application, there 
will be a Server module which stores and manages files uploaded by Client modules. Each file 
on the server belongs to the client who uploaded it, but other clients in the system are able to 
download. In other words, the uploaded files are automatically shared. Each client can delete 
or update its own uploaded files. Every client can view what files have been uploaded and by 
whom.
